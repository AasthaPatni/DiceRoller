This is a simple C# program that simulates rolling two dice and displays the result using two PictureBox controls. The program uses the Random class to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, which correspond to the faces of a six-sided die.

When the user clicks the "Roll Dice" button, the program generates two random numbers and displays the corresponding dice images in the PictureBox controls. The images are stored in the user's Downloads folder and are named "dice-six-faces-one.png" through "dice-six-faces-six.png".

The program uses a switch statement to display the correct dice image based on the random number generated. The SizeMode property of the PictureBox controls is set to StretchImage to ensure that the dice images are displayed at the correct size.

This program can be useful for practicing C# programming concepts such as random number generation, file paths, and image display. It can also be modified to simulate rolling different types of dice or to perform more complex dice calculations.
